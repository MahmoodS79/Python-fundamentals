# Hospital system

- There are 20 different specialization (e.g. Children, Surgery, etc)
- For each specialization, there are only 10 available spots (queue)
- The program keeps showing this menu of options
program options:

'1 Add new patient',

'2 Print all patients',

'3 Get next patient',

'4 Remove a leaving patient',

'5 End the program'

---

To add a patient: provide which specialization, name and status
- Specialization: 1-based integer (e.g. 1 to 20)
- Status is 0 (normal), 1 (urgent) and 2 (super urgent)
- Normal patient is added to the end of the current queue of this specialization
- Urgent patient is added after current urgents patients & before normal patients
- Super-urgent patient is added after current super-urgent patients & before urgent/normal patients
- Read the requested specialization [1-20].
- Read his name and status (0 = regular, 1 urgent)
- If 10 patients exist in this specialization, apologize and donâ€™t accept

---
Get next patient
- Given a specialization, return the top patient of the queue
   And remove from the queue
- If no patient: just inform the Dr about that

---

Remove a leaving patient
- A patient may decide to leave before seeing a doctor
- Provide specialization and name
- If no such a person: inform about that

            elif self.inp_menu == 2:

            elif self.inp_menu == 4:
                spec = valid_input(msg2,spec_list) - 1
                name = input('Enter patient name: ')
                if not rules.remove_patient(self,spec,name):
                    print('No patient with such a name in this specialization!')
            else:
                break
